 Key points for the latest version (39):
 - Wheel art has been converted to clear logos.
 - We've added more systems; the full build now has 250+ systems.
 - We have reverted the base image size back to 500GB.
 - The base now includes only cart/cass/flop systems (similar to our RetroBat build).
 - We've also added special, never-before-seen systems on Batocera!
