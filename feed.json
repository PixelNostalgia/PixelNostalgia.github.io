It is the smallest game system with interchangeable cartridges ever produced by Nintendo, weighing just under two and a half ounces (71 grams). It was first released in North America on November 16, 2001, (two days before the GameCube was released) then in Japan on December 14, 2001, and in Europe on March 15, 2002. The systems were released in three colors: Wooper Blue, Chikorita Green, and Smoochum Purple.<br><br>Features of the Pokémon mini include an internal real-time clock, an infrared port used to facilitate multiplayer gaming, a reed switch for detecting shakes, and a motor used to implement force feedback. Pokémon Channel features playable emulated demo versions of Pokémon Mini games, including the console exclusive \"Snorlax's Lunch Time\". Games such as \"Togepi's Adventure\" were only released in Japan.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">10 games (~64 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>  </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"1\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"pokemini\" folder into the 'roms' directory and Enjoy!</p>\n<p> </p>",

Categorized by Sony as a combination of a Memory Card and a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and sound capability. To use the device's memory card functionality, it must be connected to a PlayStation through a memory card slot. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.<br><br>Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD-ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Stand-alone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console. The software is then transferred to the PocketStation for use. A built-in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">75 games (~55 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>  </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"1\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"pockstat\" folder into the 'roms' directory and Enjoy!</p>\n<p> </p>",

Marketed as \"edutainment\", the main focus of the Pico was educational video games for children between 3 and 7 years old. <br><br>The Pico was released in June 1993 in Japan and November 1994 in North America and Europe, later reaching China. It was succeeded by the Advanced Pico Beena, which was released in Japan in 2005. Though the Pico was sold continuously in Japan through the release of the Beena, in North America and Europe the Pico was less successful and was discontinued in early 1998, later being re-released by Majesco Entertainment. <br><br>Releases for the Pico were focused on education for children and included titles supported by licensed franchised animated characters, including Sega's own Sonic the Hedgehog series. Overall, Sega claims sales of 3.4 million Pico consoles and 11.2 million game cartridges, and over 350,000 Beena consoles and 800,000 cartridges.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">21 games (~328 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>     </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"pico\" folder to the \"roms\" directory</p>",

It was based on a Motorola MC6809C CPU at 4 MHz, with 4k RAM memory. Later versions have been equipped with up to 64k RAM.<br>An optional multi ROM board in conjunction with a rotating dial allowed switching between 6 EPROM banks containing multiple language environments, games and applications could be added. The EPROM based language environments included EXTENDED BASIC, PASCAL, BASIC (a variant of TinyBASIC), MAD (Assembler/Disassembler) and FORTH. Games available on EPROM are TANKS, INVADERS and GALAXY WARS. Other software included MONITOR (the system BIOS which needed to be present for the system to run) and a word processor application called WORD.<br>The system also allowed loading of programs by cassette.<br><br>A network version of the Aamber Pegasus provided connectivity to a 6809-based server (SWTPC-6809). Especially the networking version attempted to address the New Zealand Government's computers in schools initiative, but never produced the hoped-for large orders. It is thought that Apple Computers introduction of the Apple II computer into the New Zealand market, and its subsequent heavy educational discounting was the final nail in the coffin for Technosys and the Aamber Pegasus computer. Total production numbers are unknown, but it is thought that less than a hundred units were ever sold.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">3 games (~3 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>     </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"pegasus\" folder to the \"roms\" directory</p>",
