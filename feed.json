The Micro began life as an upgrade to the Atom, originally known as the Proton.<br><br>The Atom was a progression of the MOS Technology 6502-based machines that the company had been making from 1979. The Atom was a cut-down Acorn System 3 without a disk drive but with an integral keyboard and cassette tape interface, sold in either kit or complete form. In 1980 it was priced between £120 in kit form, £170 (equivalent to £745 in 2020) ready assembled, to over £200 for the fully expanded version with 12 KB of RAM and the floating-point extension ROM.<br><br>It had an MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) video chip, allowing for both text and graphics modes. It could be connected to a TV or modified to output to a video monitor. Basic video memory was 1 KB but could be expanded to 6 KB. Since the MC6847 could only output at 60 Hz, meaning that the video could not be resolved on a large proportion of European TV sets, a 50 Hz PAL colour card was later made available. Six video modes were available, with resolutions from 64×64 in 4 colours, up to 256×192 in monochrome. At the time, 256×192 was considered to be high resolution.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">14 games (~16 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957611\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>   </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"atom\" folder to the \"roms\" directory</p>",

The initial model, the 520ST, saw limited release in April–June 1985 and was widely available in July. The 520ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1.<br><br>The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors, 256 KB or more of RAM, and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces. This generation includes the Macintosh, Amiga, Apple IIGS, and in some markets the Acorn Archimedes. \"ST\" officially stands for \"Sixteen/Thirty-two\", which refers to the Motorola 68000's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals.<br><br>The ST was sold with either Atari's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor. The system's color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">1452 games (~6,89 GB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957591\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>   </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"atarist\" folder to the \"roms\" directory</p>",

All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips. This architecture enabled graphics and sound more advanced than contemporary machines, and gaming was a major draw. First-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform's killer app. The systems launched with plug and play peripherals using the Atari SIO serial bus, an early analog of USB.<br><br>The Atari 400 was initially almost half the cost of the Atari 800. Instead of the 800's full-sized keyboard, the 400 has a pressure-sensitive panel. The 800 has a second cartridge slot and a larger case allowing RAM upgrades to 48K. Both models were replaced by the XL series in 1983, then–after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation–the XE models in 1985. The XL and XE are lighter in construction while having Atari BASIC built-in and 2 joystick ports instead of 4. The 130XE increased the memory to 128 KB of bank-switched RAM.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">651 games (~2,85 GB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>   </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"atari800\" folder to the \"roms\" directory</p>",

The VCS was renamed to the Atari 2600 at the time of the 5200's launch. The 5200 was created to compete with the Intellivision, but wound up a direct competitor of the ColecoVision shortly after its release. While the Coleco system shipped with the first home version of Nintendo's Donkey Kong, the pack-in game for the 5200 was 1978's Super Breakout which had already appeared on the Atari VCS and Atari 8-bit computers in 1978 and 1979 respectively.<br><br>The 5200's internal hardware is almost identical to that of Atari's Atari 8-bit family, although software is not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers have an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, pause, and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way Atari CX40 joystick of the 2600, but it was a focal point for criticism.<br><br>On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the Atari 7800 was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued after just two years on the market. Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units, far short of its predecessor's sales of over 30 million.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">70 games (~557 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957622\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>   </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"1\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"atari5200\" folder into the 'roms' directory</p>",

Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges (a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976). The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge: initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.<br><br>The Atari VCS launched with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges. The system found its killer app with the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful, leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983–84, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Pitfall! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II: Lost Caverns.</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">647 games (~1,59 GB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=954532\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>   </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"1\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"atari2600\" folder into the 'roms' directory</p>",

The systems are based on Acorn's own ARM architecture processors and the proprietary operating systems Arthur and RISC OS. The first models were introduced in 1987, and systems in the Archimedes family were sold until the mid-1990s.<br><br>ARM's RISC design, a 32-bit CPU (using 26-bit addressing), running at 8 MHz, was stated as achieving 4.5+ MIPS, which provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit home computers, such as Acorn's previous machines. Claims of being the fastest micro in the world and running at 18 MIPS were also made during tests.<br><br>The name \"Acorn Archimedes\" is commonly used to describe any of Acorn's contemporary designs based on the same architecture. This architecture can be broadly characterised as involving the ARM CPU and the first generation chipset consisting of MEMC (MEMory Controller), VIDC (VIDeo and sound Controller) and IOC (Input Output Controller).</p>\n\n<h5>The package includes:</h5>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">131 games (~516 MB)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://back-ups.me/details.php?id=957620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"btn btn--green\">Go to download</a>   </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"true\" data-translation=\"Add images\"> </div></div>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br>This system is already included in our base builds for either RetroBat, Batocera or both.<br>It is being made available to support future \"Barebones\" editions of the builds that come without any ROMs.<br>If you already use one of the following, then you DO NOT need to download this.<br><br>-RetroBat v6 Base Edition 300 GB [RGS]<br>-Batocera v40 Base Edition 500 GB [RGS]<br><br>If \"Barebones\" editions of our builds are now available, please download as needed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>How to install:</strong><br>Drag and drop the \"archimedes\" folder to the \"roms\" directory</p>",
